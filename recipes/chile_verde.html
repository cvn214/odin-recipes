    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Chile verde with pork is a filling and comforting Mexican- inspired meal. It uses the affordable pork shoulder as its main protein, that gets tender and flavored in an instant pot, or pressure cooker. The pressure cooker method cuts the cooking time, making this a realistic week night meal. The meat gets cooked right in the salsa vegetables, so clean up is a lot easier too! </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>4 pounds (1.9kg) boneless pork shoulder, cut into 2-inch chunks</li>
        <li>3/4 pound tomatillos (about 4 large tomatillos; 350g), quartered, husks discarded</li>
        <li>2/3 pound poblano peppers (about 2 peppers; 300g), roughly chopped, seeds and stems discarded (see note)</li>

        <li>2 serrano or jalape√±o chiles, roughly chopped, stems discarded (see note)</li>
        <li>8 ounces white onion (about 1 medium; 225g), roughly chopped</li>
        <li>6 medium cloves garlic, peeled</li>

        <li>Fresh corn tortillas and lime wedges, for serving</li>

      </ul>

    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Aloo gobi is one of my favorite dishes to eat and to make! It is a magical blend of Indian flavors with cauliflower and potatoes in a zingy gravy.</p>
      <p>This recipe was developed and shared by Priya Krishna.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 medium russet potatoes, cut into 2-inch-long sticks</li>
      <li>1 medium head cauliflower, cut into small florets</li>
      <li>3 tbsp +2 tbsp olive oil divided</li>
      <li>1 tsp cumin seeds</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp ground tumeric</li>
      <li>1 small yellow onion, finely diced</li>
      <li>Pinch of asafetida (optional, but really great)</li>
      <li>Pinch of red chili powder</li>
      <li>1 tbsp julienned fresh ginger</li>
      <li>1 tbsp fresh lime juice (from about half a lime), plus more if needed </li>
      <li>1 tsp kosher salt, plus more if needed </li>
      <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro (stems and leaves), for garnish</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 deg. F. Line a baking sheet with foil. </li>
      <li>Spread the potatoes and cauliflower over the prepared baking sheet and toss them with 3 tablespoons of the oil. Spread them in an even layer and roast for 30 minutes, or until the cauliflower and potatoes have browned and slightly crisped, tossing them once halfway through the cooking time. Set the vegetables aside to cool.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, in a large saute pan over medium-high heat, warm the remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the cumin seeds and cook until they turn a medium shade of brown, about 1 minute max. Reduce the heat to medium and swirl in the turmeric. Add the onion and saute, stirring, for 4 to 6 minutes, until the onion becomes translucent. Add the asafetida (if using), red chile powder, and ginger and cook for another minute.</li>
      <li>Stir in the roasted potatoes and cauliflower, including any charred bits from the foil, and gently mix everything together (don't overmix, or the cauliflower will fall apart). Add the salt and cook for 5 to 6 minutes more, until the potatoes and cauliflower are tender (but not soggy!). Remove from the heat and add the lime juice. Taste and adjust the lime juice and salt , if needed. Garnish with the cilantro before serving. </li>
    </ol>
